The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

2# Description, overview of the project
The digital world is evolving, and so are Vanguard’s clients. Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. The critical question was: Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?

An A/B test was set into motion from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017 by the team.

Control Group: Clients interacted with Vanguard’s traditional online process.
Test Group: Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.
Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.
